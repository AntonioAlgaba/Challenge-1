# Horiseon accesibility standars

## Description

I created this projet to make the website more accesible for people with desabilities. 

This website was full of div tags what I changed for semantic HTML tags, as well as I introduced alt for all image elements.

Also I changed the css code for better reading.

I learnd HTML Semantic Elements, and HTML <img> alt Attribute.
